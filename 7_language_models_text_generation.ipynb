        "\n",
        "Language Models (LMs) are statistical models that learn the probability distribution over sequences of words, characters, or tokens. They capture the patterns and structure of natural language and can predict the likelihood of a sequence of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Language Models:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Statistical Models**: N-gram models, Hidden Markov Models\n",
        "2. **Neural Models**: RNN-based, LSTM/GRU, Transformer-based\n",
        "3. **Pre-trained Models**: GPT, BERT, T5, etc.\n",
        "4. **Autoregressive Models**: Generate text sequentially (GPT family)\n",
        "5. **Autoencoding Models**: Encode input to generate output (BERT family)\n",
        "6. **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Encoder-decoder architectures (T5, BART)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Text Generation**: Creative writing, code generation\n",
        "- **Text Completion**: Auto-complete, predictive text\n",
        "- **Machine Translation**: Language-to-language translation\n",
        "- **Text Summarization**: Abstractive and extractive summaries\n",
        "- **Dialogue Systems**: Chatbots and conversational AI\n",
        "- **Code Generation**: Programming assistance\n",
