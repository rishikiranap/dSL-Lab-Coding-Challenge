        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as:\n",

        "- **PERSON**: Names of people\n",
        "- **ORGANIZATION**: Companies, agencies, institutions\n",
