        "\n",
        "Question Answering (QA) is a computer science discipline that focuses on building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in natural language. QA systems combine techniques from information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of QA Systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Factoid QA**: Answer specific factual questions (\"Who is the president of France?\")\n",
        "2. **Reading Comprehension**: Answer questions based on given passages\n",
        "3. **Open-domain QA**: Answer questions using large knowledge bases\n",
        "4. **Conversational QA**: Multi-turn question answering in dialogue\n",
        "5. **Visual QA**: Answer questions about images\n",
        "6. **Multi-hop QA**: Questions requiring reasoning across multiple facts\n",
        "\n",
        "### QA System Architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Question Analysis**: Parse and understand the question\n",
        "2. **Document Retrieval**: Find relevant documents/passages\n",
        "3. **Answer Extraction**: Extract or generate the answer\n",
        "4. **Answer Ranking**: Score and rank potential answers\n",
        "5. **Response Generation**: Format the final response\n",
        "\n",
        "### Applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Search Engines**: Direct answers to search queries\n",
        "- **Chatbots**: Customer service and virtual assistants\n",
        "- **Educational Tools**: Tutoring and learning systems\n",
        "- **Information Systems**: Enterprise knowledge bases\n",

Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific works. Einstein is widely regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time.
